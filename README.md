# Design Patterns in Java

---

## 📖 Overview

This repository contains my complete coursework and assignments for the **Design Patterns module** at university. All implementations are written in **Java** and demonstrate practical applications of classic software design patterns through hands-on examples and exercises.

**Purpose:** Academic learning repository showcasing understanding and implementation of fundamental design patterns in object-oriented programming.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand **when and why** to apply specific patterns
- Practice **clean code principles** and object-oriented design
- Develop skills in **software architecture** and maintainable code structure
- Complete university assignments with practical pattern implementations

---
## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 11 or higher
- **IDE** (IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code)
- Basic understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming**

### Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DesignPatterns-Java.git
   cd DesignPatterns-Java
   ```

2. **Build with Gradle:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```
   *The project uses **Gradle** as build tool to manage all dependencies including JUnit for testing and other essential libraries.*

3. **Open in your IDE:**
   - Import as **Gradle project**
   - Ensure JDK is properly configured
   - Let Gradle download all required dependencies automatically

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew test
   ```

5. **Explore pattern implementations:**
   - Navigate through different pattern folders
   - Run example classes to see patterns in action
   - Study UML diagrams and documentation
