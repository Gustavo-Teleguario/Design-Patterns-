    Creational patterns, such as the Singleton and Builder patterns
    Structural patterns, such as the Adapter and Composite patterns
    Behavioral patterns, such as the Observer and Strategy patterns

Each pattern has its own directory.  Additionally, there are examples of how to use the pattern in the form of unit tests. The code is well-documented and easy to understand, making it a great resource for anyone looking to learn about design patterns in Java.
